   - Improved security warnings for production deployment

## Traefik Configuration

A complete Traefik setup has been created for ChronoChimp with the following files:

1. **traefik-middleware.yaml**: Middleware configuration for security, compression, and headers
2. **traefik-config.yaml**: Full dynamic configuration with routers and services
3. **traefik-docker-compose.yml**: Docker Compose file for running Traefik
4. **traefik-static-config.yml**: Static configuration file
5. **TRAEFIK_SETUP.md**: Complete setup instructions
6. **setup-traefik.sh**: Interactive setup script

The configuration includes:
- Automatic SSL certificate provisioning with Let's Encrypt
- HTTP to HTTPS redirection
- Secure headers configuration
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Proper forwarding of proxy headers
- Authentication for the Traefik dashboard

To set up Traefik with ChronoChimp, run:
```bash
./setup-traefik.sh
```

## Remaining Tasks

1. **DNS Configuration**
   - Set up DNS records for your domain to point to your server
   - Add a CNAME record for traefik.yourdomain.com if using the dashboard

2. **Production Security**
   - Set strong, unique JWT_SECRET in production
   - Configure secure passwords for all services
   - Ensure all sensitive data is properly encrypted

3. **Testing**
   - Test secure cookie transmission with browser inspector
   - Verify API key authentication through the proxy
   - Check that all routes are properly secured

## Usage Instructions

### Testing Production Configuration
```bash
# Run the production environment test script
./scripts/test-production-env.sh
```

### Switching Environments
```bash
# Switch to development environment
./scripts/env-manager.sh dev

# Switch to production environment
./scripts/env-manager.sh prod

# Show current environment status
./scripts/env-manager.sh status
```

### Deployment with Traefik
1. Set up Traefik on your production server
2. Configure proper labels in docker-compose.yml
3. Set NEXT_PUBLIC_TRUST_PROXY=true in .env.production
4. Start the production container with `docker-compose up -d prod`
