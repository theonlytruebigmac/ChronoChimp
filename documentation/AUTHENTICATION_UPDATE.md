# Authentication System Update

## Summary of Changes
We've updated the authentication system in ChronoChimp to consistently support both session-based and API key authentication across all endpoints. This enables both browser-based applications and API integrations to securely access the application.

## Key Components Modified

### Core Authentication Components
1. **middleware.ts**
   - Fixed header forwarding (including Authorization headers)
   - Improved error handling and debugging
   - Added consistent header setting for API key auth

2. **/api/auth/validate-key/edge/route.ts**
   - Fixed to properly forward to internal validator
   - Added improved error handling

3. **/lib/auth.ts**
   - Used common getAuthUserId and verify functions across all endpoints
   - Fixed JWT payload handling for consistent id/userId field access

### Updated API Endpoints
We've updated all API endpoints to:
1. Use the common authentication functions
2. Return consistent error responses
3. Support both authentication methods
4. Add proper role-based access control for admin routes

#### User Endpoints
- /api/me/profile
- /api/me/api_keys
- /api/me/password
- /api/me/2fa/setup-initiate and /api/me/2fa/setup-verify
- /api/me/smtp/test-connection

#### Task Endpoints
- /api/tasks
- /api/tasks/[taskId]

#### Admin Endpoints
- /api/admin/users (with role checking)
- /api/admin/invites (with role checking)
- /api/admin/smtp-status (with role checking)
- /api/admin/users/[userId] (with role checking)
- /api/admin/invites/[inviteId] (with role checking)
- /api/admin/invites/[inviteId]/resend (with role checking)

#### Database Endpoints
- /api/db/api-keys

## Testing
Added a test script at `scripts/test-api-auth.sh` to verify API authentication works across endpoints.

## Documentation
Updated README.md with information about both authentication methods and usage examples.

## Next Steps
1. Test all API endpoints with the test script to ensure they work with both authentication methods
2. Consider adding more detailed API documentation for external integrations
3. Implement API rate limiting for the API key authentication method
